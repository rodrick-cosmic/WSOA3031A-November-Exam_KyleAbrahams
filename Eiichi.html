                WE MOVE TO ICHIGO, A BIRACIAL JAPANESE/AMERICAN MAN STANDING UP STRAIGHT WITH HIS ARMS SPREAD TO HIS SIDES AS SECURITY FRISKS HIM.

                DAISY, the burly African-American bouncer stops frisking down ICHIGO and stands up towering over him.

                    THE BAR IS FAIRLY BUSY, THE DENIZENS ARE MOSTLY ENGAGED IN PLAYING POOL OR WATCHING “SUPERPOWERED SMACKDOWN” AT THE BAR COUNTER’S MOUNTED TV.

                    THE DENIZENS ARE ALL SKETCHY-LOOKING INDIVIDUALS AND ARE CLEARLY ARMED.

                    <p> <br>
                    The voice comes from a Mild-40s Caucasian man with long blonde hair, he wears aviators and a denim biker vest and tank top combo. 
                    <p> <br>
                    SAMURAI is playing pool and deep in focus.

                    Sorry…
                    <p> <br>
                    SAMURAI hits the cue ball sinking one of his opponents balls.

                     Mr. Ishimura, how did today’s “consultation” go?
                     <p> <br>

                    Uh it went GREAT actually, got the doctor’s note and everything.
                    <p> <br>
                    SAMURAI still standing beside the pool table extends his left hand toward ICHIGO, who confidently walks over to SAMURAI before handing him a wad of cash.

                    I’ve taken shits heavier than this.

                    Everyone else in the pool room glares at ICHIGO.

                    SAMURAI sinks the 8-ball.

                    Y’know when I first bought that photo it was worth more than my car.
                    <p> <br>
                    But after Metro-Boy’s little controversy, it’s worth nothing.

                    No, Aristotle was a Greek poet. And he once said,
                    <p> <br> “the greatest crimes are not those committed for the sake of necessity but those committed for the sake of superfluity or excess”.

                    East?
                    <p> <br>
                    That’s Ghost territory, they’ll never let us in.

                    Who said we're asking, by little visit, I meant a particularly explosive one.

                    Please don’t tell me when you say explosive you mean-

                    <p> <br>
                    -Those beautiful brown eyes of yours need to vaporize some gangbangers?
                    <p> <br> That’s exactly what I mean.
                        <p> <br>

                    <p> <br>
                    And to think I promised myself I wouldn’t use my powers…
