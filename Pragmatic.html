            <p> <br>
                It was a Thursday night at Jazzer’s and as far as Thursday nights went, this was shaping up to be a good one. 
                <p> <br>
                It was all-you-can-drink night and the promise of cheap booze and even cheaper women had enticed Tommy who subsequently dragged his old friend to the dingy nightclub.
                <p> <br>
                 “-Alright, Tommy, I get it, I get it, she praised your bedroom skills now cut to the chase. Who was the woman?” 
                <p> <br>
                A crude smirk lit up Tommy's face as he shook his head. He picked up the lager and took a massive swig before putting it down and wiping his mouth with his hand.
                <p> <br>
                "A man only interested in the climax eh signor Dante? Y'know speaking of women you must be a real hit with 'em?" 
                <p> <br>
                "Well…never had any complaints," Dante said as he shifted his eyes to the jukebox in the corner, he could have sworn ‘Ballroom Blitz’ had been playing for the past three hours interrupted by the occasional bottle breaking.
                <p> <br>
                "That's probably because they’s was too disappointed to even say anythin' but let me get to tha 'happy ending' just for you sweetie. The girl I’s was fuckin’ was Enzo Maltismo's wife. He found out and as you can imagine he wasn't too happy, I’m sure neither was his kids becaus’ they saw their pops lose his shit."
                <p> <br>
                Dante’s eyebrows furrowed as he turned to face Tommy "Jesus. So what happened?" Dante enquired.
                <p> <br>
                "I'm getting there, sweetheart, so anyway he's sworn to 'make me sorry I was ever born ' or some shit like that. 
                <p> <br>
                I’ll probably kill him before he does but hey I’ll let ‘em dream." Tommy remarked before chugging the last of his beer and slamming the empty bottle down.
                <p> <br>
                “Ti sventro come il maiale che sei, cazzo!” From the nightclub’s entrance, an unkempt man and his cronies were fighting their way inside. 
                <p> <br>
                “Speak of the devil-” , Dante stared at Enzo and his crew as they fought through security and entered the club.
                <p> <br>
                Tommy slowly unholstered his revolver as the patrons began to panic in the commotion.
                <p> <br>
                “-And he shall appear, well Dante, let us make like our ancestors and do as the Romans do.”
                <p> <br>
